# Deep-Kerzing
Deep-Kerzing is an airline reservation systems with simple UI which guarantees ease of use and extraordinary UX. Data about airports and flights are collected from [Egypt Air](https://www.egyptair.com/en/Pages/HomePage.aspx) and [Turkish Airlines](https://www.turkishairlines.com/) websites.

### Motivation
This project is a group-based project for the Advanced Computer Lab course at the German University in Cairo, which aimed to create a complete airline system from scratch using MERN stack. This course is meant to be a self-learning one with minimal tutors intervention.

### Technical Overview
Deep-Kerzing website was created using the MERN stack framework, which is one of the most used frameworks in web development context.
>Geeks for Geeks: MERN Stack is a Javascript Stack that is used for easier and faster deployment of full-stack web applications. MERN Stack comprises of 4 technologies namely: MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js. It is designed to make the development process smoother and easier.

### Error-Free Build
Except for the styling, this build is free from errors and all functionalities are functioning as wished.

### Code Style
Since it's a react-based frontend, components were created once and reused whenever needed. Communication between components followed these approaches. First one was using props in order to contact between parent and children components. The second approach is useContext, which offered an easy way to communicate between unrelated different components.

### What makes Deep-Kerzing so special?
Following the "Simpler is Better" concept, Deep-Kerzing offers extremely simple user interface which ensures easy navigation through the website without need of any help or clues.
Website navigation is fully reversible, without losing any selections made by the user. As a user, being lost during the reservation process is impossible, as a stepper will be your companion during the full process which ensures all data is entered correctly with no missing fields, with the next button is disabled as long as there are missing fields as shown in the picture below.

All ticket information will be visible while choosing the flight card, yet only the relatable information will appear in the summary on the right.
